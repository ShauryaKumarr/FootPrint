# Assets for Rewards dashboard

Images used on the Rewards page. Some are loaded from here; others use placeholder URLs until you add your own.

## Already in use (imported in RewardsDashboard.jsx)
- `tesla.jpeg` — EV / Tesla card
- `hilton.jpeg` — Hotel / upcoming trip card
- `futurecard.jpeg` — FutureCard CTA block

## Optional (replace placeholders)
Add these to `src/assets` and we can switch the code to use them for a fully custom look:

| File | Used for |
|------|----------|
| `solar.jpeg` | Suggested alternatives — Electricity → Solar card |
| `carbon-dividend.jpeg` | Real-world impact — Carbon tax dividend card (savings / sustainability) |
| `flight.jpeg` | Real-world impact — Flight carbon credits card (airplane / travel) |

Transit in Suggested alternatives and Flight in Real-world impact currently share a placeholder; you can use one image for both or add a separate `transit.jpeg` if you add a second placeholder swap in the code.
